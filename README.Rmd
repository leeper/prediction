The **prediction** and **margins** packages are a combined effort to port the functionality of Stata's (closed source) [`margins`](http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?margins) command to (open source) R. **prediction** is focused on one function - `prediction()` - that provides type-safe methods for generating predictions from fitted regression models. `prediction()` is an S3 generic, which always return a `"data.frame"` class object rather than the mix of vectors, lists, etc. that are returned by the `predict()` methods for various model types. It provides a key piece of underlying infrastructure for the **margins** package. Users interested in generating marginal (partial) effects, like those generated by Stata's `margins, dydx(*)` command, should consider using `margins()` from the sibling project, [**margins**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins).

In addition to `prediction()`, this package provides a number of utility functions for generating useful predictions:

 - `find_data()`, an S3 generic with methods that find the data frame used to estimate a regression model. This is a wrapper around `get_all_vars()` that attempts to locate data as well as modify it according to `subset` and `na.action` arguments used in the original modelling call.
 - `mean_or_mode()` and `median_or_mode()`, which provide a convenient way to compute the data needed for predicted values *at means* (or *at medians*), respecting the differences between factor and numeric variables.
 - `seq_range()`, which generates a vector of *n* values based upon the range of values in a variable
 - `build_datalist()`, which generates a list of data frames from an input data frame and a specified set of replacement `at` values (mimicking the `atlist` option of Stata's `margins` command)

## Simple code examples

```{r opts, echo = FALSE}
library("knitr")
options(width = 100)
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = imgur_upload, base.url = NULL)
opts_chunk$set(fig.width=7, fig.height=4)
```

A major downside of the `predict()` methods for common modelling classes is that the result is not type-safe. Consider the following simple example:

```{r predict}
library("stats")
library("datasets")
x <- lm(mpg ~ cyl * hp + wt, data = mtcars)
class(predict(x))
class(predict(x, se.fit = TRUE))
```

**prediction** solves this issue by providing a wrapper around `predict()`, called `prediction()`, that always returns a tidy data frame with a very simple `print()` method:

```{r prediction}
library("prediction")
(p <- prediction(x))
class(p)
head(p)
```

The output always contains the original data (i.e., either data found using the `find_data()` function or passed to the `data` argument to `prediction()`). This makes it much simpler to pass predictions to, e.g., further summary or plotting functions.

Additionally the vast majority of methods allow the passing of an `at` argument, which can be used to obtain predicted values using modified version of `data` held to specific values:

```{r at_arg}
prediction(x, at = list(hp = seq_range(mtcars$hp, 5)))
```

This more or less serves as a direct R port of (the subset of functionality of) Stata's `margins` command that calculates predictive marginal means, etc. For calculation of marginal or partial effects, see the [**margins**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=margins) package.
